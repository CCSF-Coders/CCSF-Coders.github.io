New-CCSF-Website
================

This project was started to recreate the CCSF Coders' Club website in an
indy-hacker fashioned theme. This site is intended to provide backend utilities
to users eventually, and currently serves as an information base for the Coders
Club.

Developer Notes
===============

Some boilerplate notes: project wide, let's use the same tabbing convention

* Tab size: 2
* Tab type: spaces

Always indent inside of blocks on newlines. This is not considered throughout
the project thus far and should be considered from now on.

Types of block criteria:

* HTML/PHP tags
* CSS selectors
* JavaScript and PHP functions
* Loops and if statements of any kind

For example

    <?php
      $var = ["Hello", "World"];
      foreach($var in $value) {
        echo $value;
      }
    ?>

    <p>
      Hello, World.
    </p>

Proper comments should be used where needed. This hasn't been used enough
in the project, and should be considered from now on.

This website is currently under construction and desires various graphical
and formatting improvements.
