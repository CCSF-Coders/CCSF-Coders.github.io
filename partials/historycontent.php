      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>The Coder's Club has had a long and successful journey at CCSF. Since our conception in 2012.
         We have held weekly meetings for 5 semesters where we focus on tech news around the globe, share
         the projects we are working on with other students and team up to solve coding challenges. We focus
         on being very inclusive to anyone potentially interested in tech-related stuff. We do not narrow
         our focus to any certain type of programming, programming in general or getting work in the industry.
         An interest is all that is "required" to show up to our weekly meetings.</p>

        The Campus Wide Events we hold at CCSF is one of our favorite things we do as a club. We partner with
        the non-profit <a href="#">OpenHatch</a> to provide a full Saturday packed with food, learning how to
        contribute real open source projects and meeting local bay area open source hackers. Some of the regular
        hackers that show up are from prestigious groups like Mozilla and Ubuntu, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are always looking for more events to host or sponsor. Please get in contact with us if you have an idea or plan!
