      <h1>Lightning Talk?</h1>
      <p>
        Lightning Talks are student delivered speeches that can be about anything that gets the speaker excited.
        The catch: The speech can <i>only</i> be 10 minutes long. You will be surprised at how quickly 10 minutes disappears when you
        are in front of a group of people, so we ask that speakers come prepared with some type of PowerPoint-like
        slide show.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone can participate in challenges, including non-club members! As Drew Carey says "Everything is made up,
        and the points don't matter!" To participate, feel free to join us on the Google Group and make a new thread
        with your idea for a speech.
