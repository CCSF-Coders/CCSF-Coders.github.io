    <h1> New Website </h1>

    <p class="body">
      So we have a new website! Rebuilding it was a learning experience for me and hopefully improved 
      the look and feel of the website. With this first blog post I’d like to list what I 
      hoped to accomplish. Of course the website should be a landing page for anyone who is looking up 
      coders club to attend. I think it would be nice if it had some content that people (member and non 
      members) could come back to enjoy. I would like it to express who we are more than with a 
      statement but with style, as well serve as a playground for club members. I’d like to see changes 
      made weekly contributed by different members.

    <h2>The Blog</h2>
    <p class="body">
      The blog is self explanatory. Basically I think every member should. Be able to create blog posts, 
      the content of which can be anything they want and occasionally outlining what were doing as a organisation, 
      for example I’m sure there would be a post about open hatch after it happens. 

      How it will work technically has yet to be determined. Kevin and I plan to build a web based blog 
      application, where you can post in a form like you would post to Tumblr, or Wordpress. And I don't particularly 
      think we need a login system(discussion I've been having with Kevin). I think we could just have a sort of Blog Master, 
      who you send your post to, and they post it for you. But how it actually works isn't that important to me, as long 
      as it accessible and engaging to the club members.

    <h2>The Toy Box</h2>
    <p class="body">
      The Toy Box is my favorite idea I’ve had for the website. Basically the point is to provide a place 
      for Club members to showcase the projects they have worked on. What differentiates it from the blog 
      is that, it isn't just going to talk about the things we have made, its going have them 
      accessible for you to play with. 

      For example Ganni and Kevin made a game for an event at SETI, the game could be a toy in the toy box and 
      people who visit the site would be able to play it.  It will be a way to honor past club members and 
      serve as a sort of portfolio for current club members, by linking their Git Hub and social networking.

      When I create something I like to be able to create be able to show off the results, and I think the toy box will be a way to 
      encourage programmers to create an appealing final product.

    <h2>Never Complete</h2>
    <p class="body">
      I don't think the website should ever be finished. I would love to see it be as dynamic as possible 
      and change on a weekly basis. I would like to say that I am finished with it, but I will only consider it a success if it is 
      changed by others. If you have ideas, or feature suggestions, please build them and integrate them into the site and contact 
      me if you need me to explain the code. This website should belong to everyone, so I encourage you to make it yours.

    <h2>Thanks Kevin</h2>
    <p class="body">
      Kevin has fixed my broken code and implemented things I would never have been able to do by myself. He continues to want to 
      build more and more code for everything, I can't thank him enough.
