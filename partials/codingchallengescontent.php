      <h2>Coding Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Written by club members and implemented in any language they prefer, coding challenges provide a
        creative outlet for many of our members to invent solutions to atypical problems. The challenges
        are presented once a week, usually at the end of a club meeting. The challenges can be proposed by anyone
        but usually a club officer will prepare a challenge in advance. Occasionally, "nightmare modes" will be
        available for certain challenges, offering a higher level of difficulty due to some type of restriction to
        the type of answers that "count." 
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone can participate in challenges, including non-club members! As Drew Carey says "Everything is made up,
        and the points don't matter!"

        <p>
          Write code in any language you like that makes it look like you are adding 2+2 but the evaluation 
          of your code outputs 5. The goal is to make the code hide the fact that its manipulating the answer 
          to be 5. The trickier and more subtle your code is, the better.
