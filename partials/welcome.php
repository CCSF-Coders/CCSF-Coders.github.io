  You've found the door to the furthest reaches of human existence.

  Beyond which there is even more beyondness. We are the coders of CCSF.
  If you are interested in technology, coding, learning, advice or homework help,
  coders is the place for you!

  If not CCSF Coders club might be the place for you anyway. For example 
  do you like the internet? DO you want to build more internet? WE CAN HELP!

  CCSF coders is a group of students of varying degrees of skill but all with 
  an interest in computer science who meet up every week to work on project, 
  discuss computer science, and complain about their classes.

  To join literally all you have to do is show up to <a href="#events">our weekly meetings</a>, 
  we dislike red tape, and hierarchical structures. At coders club we
  actively attempt to include and provide safe space for women, POC, and LGBT community members.

    For the last three semesters, OpenHatch has graciously hosted their
    <i>Open Source Comes to Campus</i> workshop at the CCSF Ocean campus. This
    Spring, they're coming again for the best iteration thus far. Learn Git,
    listen to industry developers about their jobs and advice, have lunch and
    hack away at contributing to real world open source projects! This workshop
    is extremely useful to those interested in working with the open source
    community, and developers of all kinds who take advantage of Git and Github.
    See more about the event at

    we hope to see you there!
